Backgrid Object Cell
====================
Extends [Backgrid](http://backgridjs.com/) with two new cells along their editors to render and edit an object or an array of objects.
Editing is not done in the cell, but instead uses a [Bootstrap modal dialog](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals) to display either a form, or another Backgrid.
Works with Bootstrap 3 out of the box but can work with Bootstrap 2.3.
